* The application expects the instructions to be in a CSV file (kept under the resources/sample folder).
* There is a client class TradeEngineClient with a main method that can be used to run the program.
* Junits are present which cover the critical tests with respect to the rules.
* The output should be visible in the console.
* The application does not depend on any external libraries except for JUNIT which is also bundled with JDK nowdays.

### Notes on Design
* Wherever applicable design patterns like Factory/Strategy have been used for creation and usage of various business Rules
* SOLID principles of OOAD is adhered to.
* DRY is also another principle which is adhered, with code being reused as much as possible.
